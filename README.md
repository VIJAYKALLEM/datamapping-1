Choropleth maps are popular thematic maps used to represent statistical data through various shading patterns or symbols on predetermined geographic areas. The sheer amount of information these maps conveys to the viewer in such a limited space and without much explanation is amazing. It is so easy to convey a message using data visualization because it makes the trends and patterns in the data come alive.  it also allows the audience to grasp an insight into the fastest and the simplest way possible.The maps are quantiative representations of 311 complaints,firework complaints and percentage of firework complaints in total complaints recived . Quantitatibe represention helps us better understand the facts.

I think this data visualization id good for this type of date. It would be better if we could display the respective data on each zipcode on the map. it would bereat if you can display that specific data whn you over the cursor on the zipcode. Similarly, bombarding your chart with multiple trends will most likely divide the attention of the viewer and defeats the purpose of the visualization. So I think the present way of representation of date is good Data visualization should be audience-specific with a clear requirement.Keep your visualizations simple
