 Working with CSV and Shapefile data, data Joins and Field Calculator on QGIS

you will need to implement things we learned in class to wrangle data and create a data visualization on QGIS.

Here we will explore some NYC 311 aggregated data and analyze the trends around illegal fireworks in the month of June 2021.



CSV file with the count of 311 complaints in NYC by zip code for June 2021. This data contains 3 columns:

Zip code where the 311 complaint was recorded
Count of all types of 311 complaints by zip code for the month of June 2021
Count of 311 complaints related to illegal fireworks in June 2021 by zip code.


The sheer amount of information these maps conveys to the viewer in such a limited space and without much explanation is amazing. It is so easy to convey a message using data visualization because it makes the trends and patterns in the data come alive.  it also allows the audience to grasp an insight into the fastest and the simplest way possible.The maps are quantiative representations of 311 complaints,firework complaints and percentage of firework complaints in total complaints recived . Quantitatibe represention helps us better understand the facts.

I think this data visualization id good for this type of date. It would be better if we could display the respective data on each zipcode on the map. it would bereat if you can display that specific data whn you over the cursor on the zipcode. Similarly, bombarding your chart with multiple trends will most likely divide the attention of the viewer and defeats the purpose of the visualization. So I think the present way of representation of date is good Data visualization should be audience-specific with a clear requirement.Keep your visualizations simple
