Lab: Working with CSV and Shapefile data, data Joins and Field Calculator on QGIS

Explored some NYC 311 aggregated data and analyze the trends around illegal fireworks in the month of June 2021.

1.
a) Quantile representation of all types of 311 complaints by zip code for the month of June 2021

b) Quantile representation of 311 complaints related to illegal fireworks in June 2021 by zip code.

c) Quantile representation of the precent illegal fireworks takes up from the total 311 complaints in June 2021 by zip code.

2. The above maps are choropleth type maps which are popular thematic maps used to represent statistical data through various shading patterns on predetermined geographic locations. The complete amount of information these maps conveys to the audience in such a limited space and without much explanation is spectacular. This type of representation is so easy to convey a message using data visualization because it makes the trends and patterns in the data come alive and also allows the audience to grasp an insight into the fastest and the simplest way possible.The above maps are quantiative representations of 311 complaints,firework complaints and percentage of firework complaints in total complaints received respectively in NYC in June 2021. Using quantitatibe represention helps us better understand the facts. 
   According to the first map that represents all 311 complaints, it can be determined that most of the complaints were concentrated in Bronx, Harlem and Brooklyn areas. When you compare this with the second map, it can also be determined thatt he illegal fireworks complaints are also focused around the same locations. According to the final maps, it can be said that most of the 311 complaints received from Harlem and Staten Island are about illegal fireworks.

3. I think this data visualization is good for this type of data. It would be better if we could display the respective data on each zipcode on the map. It would best if we could display that specific data when the cursor is hovered over the zipcode. Similarly, bombarding the map with multiple trends will most likely divide the attention of the viewer and defeats the purpose of the visualization. Data visualization should be audience-specific with a clear requirement keeping the visualizations simple. So I think the present way of representation of data is good enough.
